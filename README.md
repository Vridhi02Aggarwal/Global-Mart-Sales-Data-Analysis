## The goal of this project is to analyze GlobalMart’s international sales data to uncover opportunities for revenue growth, cost optimization, and improved operational efficiency. 

This project analyzes 100K+ historical sales records from GlobalMart, an international retail and distribution company. The dataset covers multiple regions, product categories, and sales channels (online and offline), with details on pricing, revenue, profit, and shipping timelines. The goal of this project was to provide data-driven recommendations to optimize profitability, improve supply chain efficiency, and guide strategic regional investments.

The GlobalMart wants to expand their sales and strategies their market budget for which they want to know which regions and product categories are driving revenue and profit growth, how do sales channels (online & offline) impact performance over time, which categories or geographies should be prioritized for investment or rationalization and where we can unlock cost efficiencies in supply chain and pricing strategies.

# Insight Summary
**In order to improve the supply chain efficiency and guide strategic regional investments, we focused on the following key metrices:**

- **Total Revenue:** The sum of all the product sales across regions and channels.
- **Total Profit:** The difference between total revenue and total cost, reflecting overall business profitability.
- **Total Margin:** The percent of revenue retained as profit after costs.
- **Regional Revenue Contribution:** The share of revenue generated by each geographic region.
- **Sales Channel Performance:** The distribution of sales and revenue between online and offline channels of GlobalMart accross all the countries.
- **Category Profitability:** The revenue and profit contribution of each product category.

### Total Revenue
- GlobalMart generated $133.61B in total revenue between 2010–2017. Revenue peaked in 2014–2015, before offline sales started to decline post-2016.
- The highest revenue was generated through two categories 'Household Items' ($27.7B)and 'Office Supplies' ($27.5B).
- Intrestingly enough, the Total profit generated by 'Office Supplies' and 'household Items' is lower than 'Costemics' whose total revenue is far lower than both.

### Total Profit
- Overall profit was $39.41B, yielding a 29% profit margin. High-margin categories such as Cosmetics and Household goods were key drivers of profitability.
- Cosmetics generates the highest total profit (~$7.3B) despite moderate units sold. High unit price and strong margins indicate luxury or premium positioning.
- Household goods are #2 in profit (~$6.9B) with similar high pricing power.
- Both categories should be prioritized for marketing investment and premium brand positioning.
  
### Regional Revenue Contribution
- Sub-Saharan Africa ($34.95B) and Europe ($34.24B) accounted for over 50% of total revenue combined.
- North America ($2.93B) underperformed significantly, highlighting a potential growth opportunity in a high-value market.
- North America could be a focus area for strategic expansion, while Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe need investments to sustain leadership. Whereas, Asia has Moderate revenue, with potential for targeted campaigns.

### Sales Channel Performance
- Offline Dominated Early Years (2010–2013) but revenue growth plateaued.
- Online Sales Surpassed Offline in 2017, indicating digital transformation and e-commerce acceleration.
- This could suggest digital channels are increasingly critical for future growth.We can prioritize disigital strategy-personlized marketing, supply chain automation and online customer experience.

### Category Profitability
- Cosmetics (approx. $7.3B) and Household goods (approx. $6.9B) delivered the highest profits, despite moderate unit volumes.
- Baby Food drove strong unit sales (~41.9M units) but much lower profits, indicating price-sensitive demand.
- Fruits and Beverages had minimal profit contribution, highlighting margin challenges in commodity categories.
- We can focus marketing and pricing strategies on premium products and rationalise low-margin categories.

# Recommendations

- **Invest in Premium Categories:** Allocate more marketing spend to Cosmetics, Household Goods, and Office Supplies to capitalize on high profitability.

- **Accelerate E-Commerce Growth:** Optimize online channels, expand regional warehouses, and invest in data-driven customer segmentation.

- **Regional Strategy Differentiation:** Strengthen leadership in Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe while targeting growth campaigns in North America and Asia.

- **Portfolio Rationalization:** Reassess low-margin categories (Fruits, Beverages) to reduce overhead and improve ROI.

- **Supply Chain Optimization:** Explore vendor renegotiations and localized distribution to cut shipping delays and costs, especially for heavy items (Meat, Office Supplies).
